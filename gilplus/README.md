# GilPlus

when adding a transaction, instead of a plain list, display icons (which are easier to tap)

"folder" accounts must display themselves as an option, in addition to their children.

example:

> expenses
> > utilities
> > > gas
> > > elec
> > > water
> > groceries

clicking on "utilities" will display

[G] gas  [E] elec  [W] water
[ other "Utilities" ]
